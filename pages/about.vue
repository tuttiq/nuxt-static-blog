                If you don't know me yet, I'm Tutti (or
                <a href="https://twitter.com/tuttiq">@tuttiq</a> online). I'm a

                I'm originally from Brazil (Campinas, SÃ£o Paulo), where I got my
                CS major, moved to work in London for a while and currently I'm
                living and working in Tokyo.

              a weird story of how I got into programming
            </a>
            , but I actually majored in Computer Engineering (which, back at
            that time, was basically Computer Science + some random Engineering
            core subjects like Mechanics, Chemistry and a ton of Calculus and
            Physics).

          <p>
            On my 4th year of college (2011) I started working as a Software
            Engineer, mainly with web technologies like Java, C#, Ruby on Rails
            and Javascript (Coffeescript and jQuery at that time!). Then I went
            on to work a bit with Android app development at Samsung Brasil, and
            after that was when I moved to London to be a Ruby on Rails engineer
            for an EdTech startup named
            <a href="https://www.quipper.com/">Quipper</a>.

                Quipper was acquired by the giant Japanese corporation
                <a href="https://recruit-holdings.com/">Recruit Holdings</a> and
                after about 2 years working for them in London, I decided to try
                out moving to their office in Tokyo.

                I've been in Japan since September 2017, and around October 2018
                I moved from Quipper to become an Engineering Program Manager at
                <a href="https://about.mercari.com/en/">Mercari</a>. I've
                managed a team called Engineering Office, composed of technical
                program managers (engineers and non-engineers), working on
                technical trainings and projects to improve the overall
                engineering culture at Mercari. At that time, I wrote an article
                exaplaining our approach to

              <p>
                After working with people-centric programs on the engineering
                divison, I've now moved to manage the People Programs team, a
                team focused on company-wide D&I (Diversity & Inclusion) and L&D
                (Learning & Development) programs. In this team we manage all
                programs related to diversity & inclusion, onboarding and
                training of new employees and leadership development for
                managers, focused on strategy, execution and people management.

            Besides my main job, I also find time (somehow) to be involved with
            some developer communities and organizations. I'm a volunteer
            Director of
            <a href="/projects#wwcode-tokyo">Women Who Code Tokyo</a> and
            organizer of the
            <a href="/projects#leaddev-tokyo">Lead Dev meetup</a> here.
          </p>
          <p>
            I mainly help these communities organizing events, finding sponsors
            and hosts, finding speakers or speaking myself when I have a new
            talk to put out.

                Particularly with Women Who Code, I engage on all other aspects
                of managing and scaling the community, like online engagement on
                Slack or social media channels, connecting with leaders in other
                countries to share knowledge or organize larger regional events
                (

                !), producing branded swags, onboarding new volunteers and
                meeting with the other local Directors to strategize our
                efforts. Sometimes I also mentor or coach some of our members
                directly, or try to gather people to work on some cool
                <a href="/projects#others">side-project</a> for learning
                purposes.

            And of course, like any other human being, sometimes I need to
            disconnect and just spend some time on my random forms of leisure.
            My favorite activities are to hangout with friends (usually on a
            hunt for the best brunch places in Tokyo!), reading (I can finally
            say that after so many years that I never touched a book!) and
            cooking (I occasionally post my <s>masterpieces</s> attempts on
            Instagram ðŸ™‚).

            A quick summary of my career
          </h4>
          <p>
            I have a weird story of how I got into programming, but I actually
            majored in Computer Engineering (which, back at that time, was
            basically Computer Science + some random Engineering core subjects
            like Mechanics, Chemistry and a sh*t ton of Calculus and Physics).
          </p>
          <p>
            On my 4th year of college (2011) I started working as a Software
            Engineer, mainly with web technologies like Java, C#, Ruby on Rails
            and Javascript (Coffeescript and jQuery at that time!). Then I went
            on to work a bit with Android app development at Samsung Brasil, and
            after that was when I moved to London to be a Ruby on Rails engineer
            for an EdTech startup named
            <a href="https://www.quipper.com/">Quipper</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Quipper was acquired by the giant Japanese corporation
            <a href="https://recruit-holdings.com/">Recruit Holdings</a> and
            after about 2 years working for them in London, I decided to try out
            moving to their office in Tokyo.

              <p>
                I've been in Japan since September 2017, and around October 2018
                I moved from Quipper to become an Engineering Manager at
                <a href="https://about.mercari.com/en/">Mercari</a>. My team is
                called Engineering Office and we're a team of engineers and
                non-engineers converted into Technical Program Managers, working
                on projects to improve the overall practices and processes among
                Mercari engineering teams and provide a better employee
                experience to all engineers and leaders of the Engineering
                division (~300 people).
              </p>
              <p>
                I wrote an article about how we're

          <p>
            Besides my main job, I also find time (somehow) to be involved with
            some developer communities and organizations. I'm a volunteer
            Director of
            <a href="/projects#wwcode-tokyo">Women Who Code Tokyo</a> and
            organizer of the
            <a href="/projects#leaddev-tokyo">Lead Dev meetup</a> here.
          </p>
          <p>
            I mainly help these communities organizing events, finding sponsors
            and hosts, finding speakers or speaking myself when I have a new
            talk to put out.

                Particularly with Women Who Code, I engage on all other aspects
                of managing and scaling the community, like online engagement on
                Slack or social media channels, connecting with leaders in other
                countries to share knowledge or organize larger regional events
                (

                  WWCode CONNECT Asia
                </a>
                !), producing branded swags, onboarding new volunteers and
                meeting with the other local Directors to strategize our
                efforts. Sometimes I also mentor or coach some of our members
                directly, or try to gather people to work on some cool
                <a href="/projects#others">side-project</a> for learning
                purposes.

            And of course, like any other human being, sometimes I need to
            disconnect and just spend some time on my random forms of leisure.
            My favorite activities are to hangout with friends (usually on a
            hunt for the best brunch places in Tokyo!), reading (I can finally
            say that after so many years that I never touched a book!) and
            cooking (I occasionally post my <s>masterpieces</s> attempts on
            Instagram ðŸ™‚).

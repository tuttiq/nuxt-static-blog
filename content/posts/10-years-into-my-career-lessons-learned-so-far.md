2021 marks exactly 10 years that I started seriously working towards my career. It's been a ride and I'd like to use this moment to reflect on my journey and some of my lessons learned so far. But first...

If you don't know me or haven't had the chance to read my self-intro somewhere else, I'm Tutti ([@tuttiq](https://twitter.com/tuttiq) online), and I'm originally from São Paulo, Brazil, where I majored in Computer Engineering and started my career as a software engineer. After a couple of years working in Brazil, I moved to London (UK) for about 2 years, working as a web developer, and after that, I moved to Tokyo (Japan), where I have been for the last 3 years.

I've worked as a software engineer and then an engineering manager for about 8 years (from 2011 to 2018), and then moved into program management for the last 2 years, where I became the group manager for Diversity & Inclusion and Learning & Development at Mercari. I know, it's a bit of a jump, but I'll explain the details and how it happened throughout this article.

Also, around 2018 I became a director of Women Who Code Tokyo, the local chapter of a global non-profit organization dedicated to supporting women in tech careers. This is a side-volunteer-job that I'm still engaged in until today.

# Context: the story before my career

To give some context, I was born and raised in Brazil, state of São Paulo, in a mid-sized city 1-hour away from the capital. Both my parents have PhDs and pretty decent jobs, and we were considered a mid-high class family in Brazil. Around 2000 we bought our second computer at my house and somewhere between 2001 and 2003 we finally upgraded our dial-up internet connection to broadband.

At that time, I was 13 and a big fan of Japanese animation and manga (believe me, this is NOT why I'm in Japan now, you'll see). When I was 14~15 years old, I created a blog about Japanese anime and manga, which quickly turned into a somewhat popular website as I added more content and learned how to customize the layouts and stuff. I wrote [a more detailed story about this website here](https://tuttiq.me/how-i-created-an-unprofitable-business-when-i-was-15-years-old/). Anyways, this was basically when I got into programming, so I decided to go for Computer Engineering in college. 

Little did I know that majoring in Computer Engineering was a little bit more than making a static website with HTML and CSS (lol), but luckily I still enjoyed it. In fact, the programming subjects were my favorite ones. I was terrible at all the core engineering subjects like Calculus or Physics, but I excelled in things like Programming Languages Paradigms, I was even a teaching assistant for a short while.

But college is so much more than just going to class and studying for tests. Around my second year, I decided to lean in and get involved with a bunch of extra-curricular activities that were available. I found out about the Computer Engineering Student Union (basically, [a student-led council/organization to support student's rights and experience on campus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Students%27_union)), so I formed a party and we were elected for the upcoming term. Shortly after, I also joined as secretary-general of the Engineering Sports League, where we organized sports teams and events for all engineering majors, and, of course, fund-raising parties to enroll in regional competitions (lots of crazy memories from this time).

I then started looking for internships to fulfill my required credits.

*PS: My curriculum at that time had a requirement of 20h/week of internship for 2 entire semesters. Yes, that's right. About ~600h of mandatory internship in 1 year. I'm still pretty shocked when I hear people from the US or here in Japan talking about a "Summer internship" that lasts a few weeks or a couple of months… What can you even do with so little time??*

## My career journey

I got my first internship as a Java web developer and my second internship also as a web developer for internal tools at Bosch (mainly C# and Javascript). In my second year of internship (yes, I decided to do one more year at Bosch), I had to start my capstone project to get my degree. It was a solo project where we basically had to find a "real" client and engineer and develop a full system on their request, consulting and managing expectations, risks and trade-offs where needed. Now that I look back, that was one of my most solid experiences as a software engineer (but at the time I was freaking out about how much work I had to do). 

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vcgYZlWI-2S56jv5A71sXunh3J4s4oNm3SaXm9qNkjlh3MAHPZc-CNcsjAJCwaFXvT_V2BH7MQeOqIG4WNiHLpqfqT_cxW-mMlKgac3Z5omS-R0AvAI2UA9idx_VJS3MtFwtMdE2)When my internships were over, I got a bit worried about not having a fixed income anymore, so I got my first full-time job as a Ruby on Rails developer at a local startup. Juggling between a few classes, my capstone project, and working (more than) full-time at a small startup, I ended up postponing my graduation in about 1.5 years.

But finally, after 6.5 years, I got my degree (the "normal" would be 5 years for the major I took). Going back to my academic Java roots, I became a mobile engineer at Samsung Brazil during the years 2014 and 2015. During my time at Samsung, I had the chance to visit South Korea (Suwon) on a business trip, and that was an eye-opening experience. I decided that I really wanted to broaden my work and life experience and try living abroad for a while.

After countless attempts and literally hundreds of rejections, I finally got an offer to join [Quipper](https://www.quipper.com/), an EdTech startup based in London (UK), as a full-stack web developer, using Ruby on Rails and Backbone.js at that time. I packed everything and moved to London at the end of 2015.  

That was a very interesting experience for me. My first time living abroad, using English as my main language at work, and working for a startup that actually had a proper work-life balance (lol), I was able to travel a bit around Europe as well.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/MSU8eRhcfVzzkJGvddHmBxCD75Xs3CuZlL5xjDOIT-JYacz5TBFlsLcHRw06e-In8auBqKi2ntEjDYsjFmV8xGUDnl7PMVQrK0GWO8sIK7DE1w2JM30pzu66P_AKxC8aqKlxfTzX)

One curiosity about Quipper is that, despite having an HQ based in London, they didn't sell their product in the UK, but their main target markets were Japan, Philippines, Indonesia, and Mexico at that time (they also had much larger offices in these countries than the HQ in London). Also, one of the reasons Quipper was able to hire me from Brazil and move me to London was that they had been just recently acquired by a large Japanese corporation called [Recruit](https://recruit-holdings.com/), which also explains their large operations in Tokyo, Japan.

After about 1.5 years (mid-2017), I was thinking about my next career step, and the opportunities at Quipper UK were a bit limited since their efforts were mainly focused on the other countries. So I spoke to the CTO at the time (Tomo-san) and asked about a possible transfer to their Tokyo office, so I could be closer to their main projects and a larger spectrum of opportunities. To my surprise, it was well accepted and we decided to move forward with the transfer. In October of 2017, I moved from London to Tokyo, Japan.

Moving to Tokyo was definitely I life-changing experience and there's so much that I can talk about it, but for the purpose of this article, I'll keep it brief and focused on my work experience here.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/T4GZ4TQBaQOXJ2YiwCGiUYAn3EVs4RhJ9V__JN7w1DXHrjIQl5zwGRVUW8kh6IV14Ht71Rjp9HL-t1sv2ZyEoOnhlZZ7xwIK2mOwPHgZV4MAYkG8AlacqikGdg7_Yj4uS_F8qjQd)

In my first year here at Quipper Tokyo, I realized the language was going to be a bigger barrier than all of us anticipated. Even if a lot of the engineers were able to communicate in pretty decent English, most of the PMs, sales, and corporate side could only speak and understand Japanese, which made my possibilities fairly limited. So I was assigned to work on the global product, in collaboration with the team in Manila (Philippines). That worked out well, and I also got to visit Manila quite a few times to meet the team and our costumes (the schools using our product), which was a lot of fun. 

At this point, I had already 7~8 years of experience with software development, being more than half of it with the same tech stack (Ruby on Rails), so I naturally transitioned into a Tech Lead role, as I was usually the most senior developer on my projects. At the same time, there were a few discussions going on at Quipper about how to improve the engineer's retention and hiring process, which I decided to get involved in. Eventually, I told my manager I would like to be an Engineering Manager when possible, and that happened shortly after when a position came up. 

Also in 2018, my friend and Quipper colleague [Joy Paas](https://twitter.com/kjcpaas) introduced me to the [Women Who Code](https://www.womenwhocode.com/) organization. She was a director of the Manila chapter in the Philippines and during one of her visits here in Tokyo, she told me WWCode had a Tokyo chapter and invited me to join one of their events. I was instantly hooked on the organization and its mission: inspiring women to excel in technology careers.

Almost on a nostalgic feeling about my experience leading the student organizations, I quickly decided to be involved with Women Who Code, so I talked to the Tokyo directors at the time, [Lena](https://twitter.com/mirka) and [Himi](https://twitter.com/himisanta), and they accepted me as a volunteer and lead for some of their study sessions. Shortly after, I was invited to become a director as well.

I've explained in more detail what the team and I are doing on the Tokyo chapter of WWCode in [this article](https://tuttiq.me/what-women-who-code-is-doing-in-tokyo), but in summary, we organize events and activities for a community of local women in tech, focused on career growth, building skills, networking and more. As a director, it's also part of my role to manage the community, recruit and onboard new volunteers, make partnerships with companies, and manage our finances and operations in general.

I've also started public speaking in a more professional setting after I joined Women Who Code, being part of panels and applying as a speaker to international conferences. 

Being a part of dev communities, organizing events, and speaking at conferences not only taught me a lot of important skills but also increased my visibility and helped me make a ton of useful connections. That's when I got to know a lot more about the tech startup scene in Japan and eventually switched jobs to join [Mercari](https://about.mercari.com/en) (the largest C2C marketplace app in Japan), as part of their Engineering Office team. 

As part of the Engineering Office team at Mercari, I worked on managing programs catered for the engineering division, like improving onboarding and training for engineers, and eventually, I led a pretty big project called the Engineering Career Ladder, to revamp the level definitions and evaluation process for engineers ([more about this project on this article](https://tuttiq.me/shaping-engineering-culture-in-a-chaotic-environment-part-1)).

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/RF1M7czXI267sm6fQjXgyM7InZhY9ZiwQoVaIDjkJLLHAPkXMRQ1K8Bug1rGS0xlesqkV-mMnR1E_c84pOliH2bKzcxfkHyhrZS-kaPxjpWZDbu0Dpk3SaffruVD_PUsPyA0dkyI)

With my background as a Tech Lead and Engineering Manager, I was soon managing a team of technical program managers at Mercari. It was still a new and hard thing to manage for me, but we were learning and growing together as a team. At the same time that I was managing my team in Engineering Office, on the side, I was still very much involved with Women Who Code and, with a lot of support from my manager at the time (yes, it's you Mike <3), I was able to start several partnerships and collaborations between Women Who Code and Mercari, contributing to Mercari's diversity & inclusion efforts.

Eventually, after a few successful projects and some internal networking, I was invited to lead the creation of a brand new Learning & Development team on the corporate side (thanks for the trust, Daniel and Tatsuo-san), as a way to scale onboarding, training, and other people programs to the whole company, not only engineering. 

I moved to the People & Culture division, and started with a small team called People Programs, in charge of diversity & inclusion, people and leadership development. Four months later, we incorporated the Language Education team into our group, and last December, I also took over the management of the Global Operations teams (our teams of translators and interpreters), aiming to align our efforts towards people development, diversity & inclusion, language and communication support.

Currently, I'm the Group Manager for Learning & Development, Diversity & Inclusion and Global Operations at Mercari, managing 4 managers and a total of about ~20 people. I'm still a director of Women Who Code and I'm involved in a [few other side-projects](https://tuttiq.me/projects) like the [SpeakHer website](https://speakher.jp/) and creating my personal content. I also had the pleasure to speak at several events and conferences, and take a few leadership trainings that also had a great impact on my professional and personal life.

## Summarized in other words, I…

* Learned & practiced programming for years
* Helped people to learn programming (mentoring, volunteering)
* Got curious about how other things work, asked a lot of questions
* Got involved in various activities, causes, side-projects, etc
* Moved countries twice, moved jobs when needed
* Did a lot of networking and met a bunch of people
* Learned a lot through books, courses, talking to people
* Stepped up and exercised leadership whenever I saw the chance

But in the end, would you say I've had a "successful" career so far?

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/reZ_-9cn-I8uGz0AWyrsl_kSy5pzPo_gNwRjPn7S1O4Rs9oULenYiFdqdWlt9jcEUGxCcwfTRsz2sYXjBI7UtaCz_HShsB2TdnwhjowFzKmhcvELwJueMZi_KEnNtMfR_PbXvqqQ)

It's hard to define, there is no universal definition of success, and of course, no universal "benchmark" of what a successful career looks like. Some people would look at my journey and think it's amazing, how I managed to do so much. Some people would say that given my opportunities and support network, I should have achieved so much more by now. Some people would say that my current salary is high (if you're from Brazil, for example), some people would say it's fair or even low (hint: if you're working in tech in the US, for example).

I know that sounds cheesy, but I prefer to not have a benchmark and I avoid comparing myself to others. Everyone has a unique situation and personal values and therefore different priorities or things that we're optimizing for in our lives and careers. That's why I prefer to look at my career only in regards to my own expectations and what I personally value the most.

Of course, I'm not gonna be a hypocrite here and say that I don't care about money or status at all. Like anyone else, I do too. But I'm in a position where I'm privileged enough to be able to care only to a certain extent. After a certain amount of money, I don't need to have it as a first priority anymore. And with that being said…

These are the things I value the most about my career journey. Experiences, learning, contributing to society or helping people around me, making personal connections, even the brief ones, and growing as a person.

If you're at a point in which you value similar things and you'd be interested in some career advice, you can go ahead and read the next section.



# Lessons Learned (so far)

As I've already mentioned a few times across this article, but just in case you skipped straight into this section, I'd like to acknowledge the huge amount of privilege, support, and luck I've had so far. I'm not gonna sit here and tell you that anyone can have a similar career path as me just by "working hard" (especially since I don't feel like I've worked "hard" per se…). 

So let's get that out of the way: besides a ton of privilege, luck, and support I've had along the way, in regards to things that I have control over (like my behaviors and how I spend my time), I've learned the following lessons: 

* Be proactive. If you don't ask you don't get. If you don't look for it, you won't find it. If you don't try, you won't have any results.
* * Don't wait for anyone to come and tell you what to do. Make your choices, take action.
* Be a fast learner & develop critical thinking: first, absorb as much information as possible, then, on a second moment, start questioning why things work the way they do.
* * Especially useful advice when onboarding on new companies, teams, or projects
* Stay humble, there's always more to learn. Listen/read before assuming you know better.
* * The worst thing you can do is assume that you know everything about something, come off as arrogant, and still not learn anything new.
* Make meaningful & honest connections with people around you. Empathy can open a lot of doors. 
* * It goes beyond networking or "politics". Humans are social beings, and life gets a lot easier when you have true friends and allies.
  * Nothing better than [this book](https://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034) to explain the importance of empathy.
* Trust your future self. There are many things you may not know how to do yet, but trust that you will figure it out.
* * Take risks: Ask yourself "what's the worst that could happen?"
  * E.g.: When applying to a new job, when invited to a professional event, etc
* Expose yourself to opportunities, and grab onto them when they show up
* Be creative & optimistic. You can uncover "hidden" opportunities if you are creative and optimistic
